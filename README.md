Shhh! There's a kid here...
This app is a profanity filter using API provided by Gemini https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_data

## TODO
Add "your learning" into this README.md and try to make this README.md beautiful to make it representative enough

# Code
Removed all unnecessary console.logs from server.js
Use "mongodb://127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost"
Use filter_domain = "127.0.0.1" instead of "http://127.0.0.1"
